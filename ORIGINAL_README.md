Drik Panchanga
==============

Observational Indian lunisolar calendar using the Swiss ephemeris (Hindu
Drig-ganita Panchanga).

Features
--------

Computation of the five essentials of the panchangam:
* Tithi
* Nakshatra
* Yoga
* Karana
* Vaara

Not just the values, but also the end times of tithis and nakshatras
are computed. The only factor limiting the accuracy of the program
output is the uncertainity in your input values (latitude, longitude).

Also includes computation of sunrise, sunset, moonrise and moonset.

Included in the CLI version (not yet in GUI):
* Instantaneous planetary positions, including Lagna (Ascendant)
* Navamsa positions
* Choghadiya/Gauri panchanga
* Vimsottari Dasha-Bhukti
* Rahu Kala, Yamaganda Kala, Gulika Kala
* Abhijit muhurta and Durmuhurtams

Lunar months can be named in either reckoning:

* **Amānta** (amāvāsyānta) — new moon to new moon (common in much of South India)
* **Pūrṇimānta** — full moon to full moon (common in much of North India)

The PDF calendar and day Web UI expose both via `--month` / the month-system
control. Festival *catalog* entries are still keyed by amānta month numbers
(see [docs/README.FESTIVALS.md](docs/README.FESTIVALS.md)); only the printed māsa badge
and day-API māsa label follow the selected system.

NOTE:
All timings are end timings. Timings displayed higher than 24:00 denote
hours past midnight because the Hindu day (tithi) starts and ends with
sunrise. If applicable, daylight savings (DST) are accounted for
automatically based on the date and place entered in the textboxes.


Requirements
------------

The core astronomy library is on PyPI as `drik-panchanga`:

```
pip install drik-panchanga
```

That installs only `panchanga.py` (plus `pyswisseph`). Swiss Ephemeris still
needs `.se1` data files; set `SE_EPHE_PATH` or use `~/.local/share/swisseph`
(see `scripts/setup_venv.sh` in this repository).

For the full project (PDF calendar, web UI), clone the repository.
Tested with Python 3.12, Swiss Ephemeris 2.10.03 (20230604).

One-page calendar PDF
---------------------

`generate_panchanga_calendar.py` creates a single-page A4 calendar for 14
consecutive months. It is a compact yet comprehensive panchanga that lists both
_sauramāna_ (solar) and _cāndramāna_ (lunar) elements: tithi, nakshatra, yoga,
vaara, solar date, festivals and eclipses too! Each day shows:

* `T`: tithi number at local sunrise (01-15); blue ink is Sukla,
  dark ink in italics is Krsna
* `N`: nakshatra number (01-27)
* `Y`: yoga number (01-27)
* lunar-month start: green T-cell with an upper-left māsa badge (amānta or
  pūrṇimānta, per `--month`); an adhika māsa badge carries an `A` prefix in
  addition to the gold cell fill
* solar-month start (saṅkrānti): peach N-cell with rāśi number 1–12 top-right;
  following N-cells mark solar days 7, 14, 21, and 28, with the count resetting
  at each saṅkrānti

Calculations use Swiss Ephemeris. Ayanamsa options include Chitra-paksha,
Revati-paksha, Rohini-paksha, Pushya-paksha (PVRN Rao), Mula-paksha
(Usha-Shashi), Krishnamurti (KP) and Raman. Adhika months have a gold cell and
Sundays have a red right edge. T-cell underlines mark recurring observances:
teal Ekadashi upavasa, purple Pradosham (Mon/Sat), indigo Sankashtahara (Tue)
(weekday specials only; `--recurring all` underlines every occurrence). The `T`
column shows only 01-15; Sukla is upright bold and Krsna is bold italic. A brown
wavy underline below Tithi marks days with a locally visible eclipse. Numbered
red superscripts refer to the festival key below the calendar. The footer also
lists locally visible partial, total, and annular eclipses for the printed month
range, each with its local maximum time and that date's sunrise (`None` when
none qualify). Ruleset and layout versions are printed at the top right and
embedded in the PDF metadata so a generated calendar can be reproduced or
compared after rule changes.

### Setup

The PDF generator requires Python 3.9 or newer. Create a local virtual
environment and install `pyswisseph`, ReportLab, and their dependencies:

```
./scripts/setup_venv.sh
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Swiss Ephemeris needs the `.se1` data files. By default:

- Linux / macOS: `~/.local/share/swisseph` (or `$XDG_DATA_HOME/swisseph`)
- Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\swisseph`

If that directory has no `.se1` files, setup makes an optional download (~100 MB
from [aloistr/swisseph](https://github.com/aloistr/swisseph/tree/master/ephe)).
The less-accurate Moshier fallback is used until the files are present. To use
your own copy of ephemeris files:

```
SE_EPHE_PATH=/path/to/ephemeris/files ./scripts/setup_venv.sh
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Cities are stored in `data/cities.json` as ``AsciiName, CC`` (case-insensitive),
e.g. `Bengaluru, IN` (2-letter ISO country code). Pass the country code when the
city name alone is insufficient for disambiguation.

```
python generate_panchanga_calendar.py --city Ujjain --start 2026-06
python generate_panchanga_calendar.py --city "Berlin,US" --start 2026-03 \
       --month purnimanta --ayanamsa revati  --output berlin_not_germany.pdf
python generate_panchanga_calendar.py --city Tirupati --start 2026-06 \
       --ayanamsa tropical
```

`--ayanamsa tropical` uses the equinox-referenced ecliptic instead of a
fixed-star (nirayana) reference.  The PDF subtitle shows *Tropical (Sāyana)*
instead of an ayanamśa label, and the default filename gets a `_tropical` suffix.

### Festivals

Festival selection and date-selection rules are documented in
[docs/README.FESTIVALS.md](docs/README.FESTIVALS.md). Use `--festivals FILE.cfg`
to provide a custom configuration. Fortnightly/monthly observances (Ekadashi,
Pradosham, Sankashtahara Chaturthi) are always on and need no cfg keys; they are
painted as coloured bars on the monthly grid.

Festival dates themselves do not flip with `--month`: the catalog uses fixed
amānta month numbers so a named observance stays on the same civil day in both
display modes.

#### Example: Ujjain, March 2026 through March 2027

The following image is the first and only page generated by the Ujjain command
above:

![Ujjain Panchanga, March 2026 through March 2027][ujjain-panchanga-image]

[ujjain-panchanga-image]: samples/ujjain_panchanga_mar2026_mar2027.png

Monthly calendar PDF (12 pages)
-------------------------------

`generate_monthly_calendar.py` produces a 12-page A4 **portrait** PDF with one
month per page. It uses the same computation, colours and markers as the
one-page landscape calendar but with wider rows suited for reading a full
month at a glance:

```
python generate_monthly_calendar.py --city Ujjain --start 2026-03
```

The same city/month/ayanamsa/festival flags as the one-page script are
accepted. The web UI offers both layouts via separate buttons (the form field
`layout` is `one-page` or `monthly`); the monthly filename carries a
`_monthly` suffix.

#### Example: Ujjain, March 2026

<img
  src="samples/ujjain_monthly_march2026.png"
  alt="Ujjain Monthly Panchanga, March 2026"
  width="600">

Run the regression tests with:

```
python -m unittest discover -s tests -t . -p 'test_*.py'
```

To leave the virtual environment when finished, run:

```
deactivate
```

Web UI (Offline and Online)
---------------------------

Online, publicly-hosted: https://panchanga.up.railway.app/

For offline use, all web code lives under `webapp/`. With the venv activated,
from the repository root:

```
python -m webapp.app
```

Then open [http://127.0.0.1:8765/](http://127.0.0.1:8765/). Enter a city
(autocomplete against `data/cities.json`). Unique bare names work (`Bengaluru`);
ambiguous ones need ``Name, ISO`` (e.g. `Sydney, AU`). Then either:

* look up a single day’s panchanga with a `DD/MM/YYYY` date (negative years
  allowed as proleptic Gregorian), choosing amānta or pūrṇimānta for the māsa
  label, an ayanamsa (including *Tropical (Sāyana)*), or
* pick the first month of the 14-month PDF calendar range (same month-system
  and ayanamsa controls) and download the PDF — either the default one-page
  landscape layout (14 months), or a 12-page portrait layout with one month
  per page, or
* export the same 14-month span as an iCal (.ics) file (with Varjyam listed
  in each daily event) for import into Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, etc.

Override the port with `--port 9000` or `PORT` / `PANCHANGA_PORT`.

Local Docker check (repo root):

```
docker build -f webapp/Dockerfile -t panchanga .
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 -e PORT=8080 panchanga
```

Accuracy
--------

The program is as accurate as the Swiss Ephemeris installed on your system.
So generally it is accurate for years 5000 BCE to 5000 CE, especially in the
range 2500 BCE - 2500 CE. The computational speed stays the same no matter
which date you enter. Compared to other software listed in the
[References](#references), our software is way better in this sense.

As a simple test, try to compute the date of Madhva Navami, which is celebrated
as the disappearance day of the Indian philosopher
[Madhvācārya](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhvacharya). The exact date is
1317 CE, Māgha-māsa śukla-pakṣa navamī. All other software listed in
[References](#references) give error "Year out-of-range". But in our software,
enter the place "Udipi" and date "30/1/1317" and you indeed get Māgha śuddha
navamī. You can cross-verify it on the
[Calendrica website](http://emr.cs.iit.edu/home/reingold/calendar-book/Calendrica.html).

Note that dates before 1582 must be entered in
[proleptic Gregorian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proleptic_Gregorian_calendar),
which is a natural back-interpolation of the current Gregorian calendar we use
every day.


About the calendar
------------------

There are two schools of Indian calendar makers:

1. Those who follow the rules of the [_Sūrya Siddhāntā_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surya_Siddhanta)
   (SS, Theory of the Sun) or its variants like _Ārya Siddhānta_ of Aryabhata.
2. Those who follow the _Dṛk Siddhāntā_ (Empirical Theory).

SS contains semi-analytical equations for specifying the positions of sun and moon.
However, the constants in these equations have to be updated regularly ( _bīja saṃskāra_ ).
But the equations in SS were last updated around 1000 CE, so they no longer match the
planetary positions as we see today. For example, the date of solar eclipse as predicted
by the equations of SS are off by many hours from its actual occurence. In spite of this,
most Hindu maṭhas still publish yearly pañcāṅgas according to the rules of SS, in the name
of preserving and practising tradition ( _paramparā_ ).

The latter one, _Drik_ school, still follow the general concepts from SS,
but get the planetary positions from measured or observed data (dṛś = to see).
Hence, their results match accurately with observed celestial phenomena.
The [Swiss Ephemeris](http://www.astro.com/swisseph/swephinfo_e.htm) is probably
the best source available today for planetary calculations. It provides highly
accurate databases of planetary data for about 10000 years. Hence, this panchanga
is based on the Swiss Ephemeris. Other databases include those published by NASA's
JPL (DE405) or the Moshier ephemeris.

#### Śubhāśubha Samaya

Gaurī (Gowri) Panchanga and Choghadiya are south Indian and north Indian names
respectively, for the same mathematical calculation. Basically, day and night
duration are each divided into eight parts; the difference between N.Indian and
S.Indian lies in their names and which part is considered
auspicious/inauspicious. In the S.Indian variant, Tamilians use
[different order][kowri] and names compared to Kannadigas/Telugus. This program
provides the latter only. (This inconsitency alone is enough to let you know
that such concepts of (in-)auspiciousness are all pseudo-science).

Rāhukāla, Yamagaṇḍakāla, Gulikakāla, Durmuhūrtams and Varjyam are all considered
inauspicious. Abhijit muhūrta and Amṛtakāla are considered auspicious.

### Uranus and Neptune ###

These planets were not discovered by Indian astronomers. They are sometimes
translated as "[Aruṇa graha][ar_hi]" and "[Varuṇa graha][va_hi]" in languages
like Hindi, Nepali, etc. Problem is that there is another trans-Neptunian
planet which is also called [Varuna][v20k] in English.

The Positional Astronomy Center [translates][pac] them as `हर्शल` and
`नेपच्यून`. This is inconsistent in the sense that Uranus was translated after its
discoverer (William Herschel) where as Neptune was phonetically transcribed from
English, instead of basing on its discoverer (Johann Galle). Therefore, I've
"Indianized" their names in a rhyming fashion as **`हर्षल`** (=Uranus) and
**`गाल्ल`** (=Neptune). They also mean "happy" and "cheek/chin" respectively in
many Indian languages.

Other probable names are: हिमनील (=icy-blue, Uranus), इन्द्रनील
(=sapphire-colored, Neptune), तुषार (=frigid), पलाश (=green),

Prof. M. Yanom's [online interface](http://www.cc.kyoto-su.ac.jp/~yanom/pancanga/)
to his [Perl code](http://www.cc.kyoto-su.ac.jp/~yanom/sanskrit/pancanga/pancanga3.13) -- this
is the best version of the old Surya Siddhanta pancanga I've seen. However, the Surya Siddhanta
system (no fault with the Perl code) is not accurate if you want to work with dates which are
several centuries before our current time.

[drikpanchang](http://drikpanchang.com) is a reliable online calendar for the Drik.  However, it is
neither open source nor do they have a desktop program. This website doesn't work for dates before
1600 CE. Their [Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.drikp.core) doesn't
work for dates outside the range 1900 - 2100 CE.


[Hindu Calendar](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.alokmandavgane.hinducalendar)
for Android is another offline Drik calendar by Alok Mandavgane. Again, this is
not open source. This software has a bug that it doesn't account for daylight savings
in Europe. Also it doesn't work for dates outside the range 1900 - 2100 CE.

Among open source programs, I found these two:

* [On Google Code](http://panchangam.googlecode.com/svn/calc-v2): generates a pdf of
panchanga for any year and place, but imprecise. For ex., tithi end timings are off
by ten minutes sometimes. There is no GUI either.

* [On GitHub](https://github.com/santhoshn/panchanga): Based on Paul Schlyter's
semi-analytical model for [planetary positions](http://stjarnhimlen.se/comp/ppcomp.html).
This program gives the panchanga for a given _instant_ but doesn't ask for a place's
coordinates or timezone. This is probably because the program doesn't compute sunrise
timings at all! The planetary model fails for dates outside the range 1800 CE to 2100 CE.


Wx GUI (Deprecated)
-------------------

**Deprecated:** The wxPython GUI is no longer actively maintained. Use the
[Web UI](#web-ui-offline-and-online) or the PDF calendar scripts instead.

To run the GUI (`gui.py`):

```
apt-get install python3-tz python3-wxgtk4.0 python3-wheel
pip3 install --user pyswisseph  # or apt-get
python3 gui.py
```

If you want to edit the GUI, download
[wxGlade](https://github.com/wxGlade/wxGlade/releases) and run:

```
python3 wxglade.py
```

then open `config/Gui.wxg`.

### Using the GUI

#### Location known

First, type the Date in DD/MM/YYYY format in the 'Date' field. Negative value for YYYY are
interpolated as proleptic Gregorian calendar.

Second, type your location (city or district) in the Location field and click 'Search'.  If found,
then the coordinates and time zone are updated. If not, try the [next method](#location-unknown-1).
If your location's population is more than 50,000 then the location should be found.

Third, click 'Compute'. Now the fields like tithi, etc. are computed and shown on the GUI.

#### Location unknown

First, type the Date in DD/MM/YYYY format in the 'Date' field.

Second, manually enter the coordinates and time zone of your location. You can use
[Google Maps](http://maps.google.com) or [Time and Date website](http://www.timeanddate.com/) for
this purpose.

Third, click 'Compute'.  Now the fields like tithi, etc. are computed and shown on the GUI.

Word of caution
---------------

The so-called "Vedic astrology" has no basis in the Vedas, Upanishads, Bhagavad
